## Connections - Gauge

_disabled by default_. Depending on the environment and change rate it can create a high number of dead metrics. Otherwise it could be usefull and can be enabled.

Labels: cluster, vhost, node, peer_host, user, self

Please note: The data is aggregated by label values as it is possible that there are multiple connections for a certain combination of labels.

metric | description
-------| ------------
|connection_channels|number of channels in use|
|connection_received_bytes|received bytes|
|connection_received_packets|received packets|
|connection_send_bytes|send bytes|
|connection_send_packets|send packets|
|connection_send_pending|Send queue size|

Labels: vhost, node, peer_host, user, *state* (running, flow,..), self

metric | description
-------| ------------
|connection_status|Number of connections in a certain state aggregated per label combination. Metric will disappear if there are no connections in a state. |

## Shovel

_disabled by default_
Labels: cluster, vhost, shovel, type, self, state

metric | description
-------| ------------
|shovel_state|A metric with a value of constant '1' for each shovel in a certain state|

## Memory

_disabled by default_
Labels: cluster, node, self

metric | description
-------| ------------
|memory_allocated_unused_bytes|Memory preallocated by the runtime (VM allocators) but not yet used|
|memory_atom_bytes|Memory used by atoms. Should be fairly constant|
|memory_binary_bytes|Memory used by shared binary data in the runtime. Most of this memory is message bodies and metadata.)|

|memory_connection_channels_bytes|Memory used by client connections - channels|
|memory_connection_other_bytes|Memory used by client connection - other|
